# search-engine-core
We are working toward a future where internet search is more open, reliable, and aligned with the values and needs of people everywhere. This community-oriented initiative encourages inclusive participation and shared benefit, aiming to complement existing structures by enhancing access, strengthening privacy protections, and promoting constructive global collaboration. Together, we can help shape a digital environment that is transparent, respectful, and supportive of all.
